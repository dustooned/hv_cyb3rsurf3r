# Ocean Grid Prototype

An HTML5 Canvas prototype for a procedural ocean-like vector grid.

The current direction is a minimal Tempest-like arcade grid: a perspective-projected wire plane with an infinite procedural wave ridge rising on the left side. This is meant to support early game mechanic exploration, visual background work, interactive art, and technical demo iteration.

## Current Prototype

The active version is a direct-file browser prototype. Open `index.html` directly to run it without installing anything.

Current features:

- Tempest-like perspective ocean grid.
- Finite rows that scroll from the horizon toward the player to imply infinite water.
- Left-side raised wave geometry.
- Blue decorative side-zone layer clipped away from the central playfield.
- Foreground surfboard vector shape.
- Lane-rail movement on the front edge of the grid.
- Tap or hold Arrow Left, Arrow Right, A, and D to move between lanes.
- Very-fast arcade timing: 50ms lane switches and 50ms hold pulses.

## Optional Vite Setup

```bash
npm install
```

## Run The Prototype

```bash
npm run dev
```

Vite will print a local URL in the terminal. Open that URL in a browser to view the animated grid.

In this environment, direct `file:///` loading has been the reliable baseline. Vite remains available for later if npm is installed.

## Source Files

- `index.html` creates the page and loads the Canvas app.
- `styles/style.css` makes the Canvas fill the full browser window.
- `src/config.js` owns the main tuning values for the grid, view, decoration, and player.
- `src/state.js` owns shared runtime state like canvas size, vertices, keys, and player position.
- `src/canvas.js` owns Canvas setup, resizing, and background drawing.
- `src/grid.js` creates, projects, and draws the Tempest-like ocean grid.
- `src/wave.js` updates procedural water height and scrolling row depth.
- `src/decor.js` draws the blue procedural side-zone decoration.
- `src/player.js` updates and draws the foreground surfboard marker.
- `src/input.js` listens for Arrow Left, Arrow Right, A, and D.
- `src/main.js` owns only startup and the animation loop.

## Version Snapshots

- `versions/v001-current-working-prototype` preserves the first working one-file runtime.
- `versions/v002-modular-runtime` preserves the first behavior-preserving modular runtime.
- `versions/v003-very-fast-arcade-lane-rail` preserves the current lane-rail control checkpoint.

## Main Tuning Points

Edit `src/config.js` first when tuning behavior.

- `GRID.scrollSpeed`: ocean row movement speed.
- `VIEW.*`: horizon, front edge, grid width, and wave lift.
- `DECOR.*`: blue decorative layer density and motion.
- `PLAYER.laneMoveDuration`: visual time to switch one lane.
- `PLAYER.holdInitialDelay`: delay before held movement starts pulsing.
- `PLAYER.holdPulseInterval`: timing between held lane pulses.
- `PLAYER.showLaneTicks`: shows or hides the front lane anchor dots.
